# Flashypoo: the Wacky, Clowny, Card Game that Helps You Learn Stuff!
A Tkinter-based, GUI that combines the basic format of flash card learning/memorization with .csv formatted files so that users can customize the program to teach themselves whatever they want to learn.

# How it Comes:
There is a .csv file titled: us_capitals.csv. The first time you run the program, this will be the file read. After closing, a new file entitled 'to_learn.csv' will be created populated with the data from the answers you did not know. When you run out of data, mistakenly press "heck yup" when you meant to press "on no!", or want to begin fresh, simply delete  "to_learn.csv" and the program will again pull data from the original .csv file. 

# Customizing!
Place a .csv formatted file in the data folder that contains whatever information you wish to learn. Customize the title of this file so that it makes sense to you.

# Art
All shitty art for this GUI was created from scratch by yours truly, the original Daniel Esquire Galanskafax for his own enjoyment. Please steal and destroy at your leisure.
