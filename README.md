# Flashypoo: the Wacky, Clowny, Card Game that Helps You Learn Stuff!
A Tkinter-based, GUI that combines the basic format of flash card learning/memorization with .csv formatted files so that users can customize the program to teach themselves whatever they want to learn.

# How it Comes:
There is a .csv files titled: us_capitals.csv. The first time you run the program, this will be the file read. After closing, a new file entitled 'to_learn.csv' will be created using the data from the answers you did not know. The "to_learn" file should always be populated through cut and paste from the original .csv file. When you run out of data, mistakenly press "heck yup" when you meant to press "on no!", or want to begin fresh, simply delete the "to_learn" file and the program will again pull from the original .csv file. 

# Customizing!
Place a .csv formatted file in the data folder that contains whatever information you wish to learn. Customize the title of this file so that it makes sense to you. Create a second copy and name it "to_learn" You will need to update the code with the new file name(s) located under the CSV FILE section of main.py

# Art
All shitty art for this GUI was created from scratch by yours truly, the original Daniel Esquire Galanskafax for his own enjoyment. Please alter and destroy at your leisure.
