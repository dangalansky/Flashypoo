# Flashypoo: the Wacky, Clowny, Card Game that Helps You Learn Stuff!
A Tkinter-based, GUI that combines the basic format of flash cards with .csv formatted files so that users can customize whatever they want to learn.

# How it Comes:
There are 2 .csv files titled: us_capitals.csv and capitals_to_learn.csv. The "to_learn" file should always be populated from the original .csv file. As you work through the cards, pressing the "heck yup" button signifies that you correctly guessed that card. The program then removes that data row from "to_learn" so future attempts will not test you on this particular piece of trivia.  

# Customizing!
Place a .csv formatted file in the data folder that contains whatever information you wish to learn. Create a second copy and name it "to_learn" You will need to update the code with the new file name(s) located under the CSV FILE section of main.py

# Art
All shitty art for this GUI was created from scratch by yours truly, the original Daniel Esquire Galanskafax for his own emjoyment. Please alter and destroy at your leisure.
